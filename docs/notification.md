## Discord bot, email API

This bot should notify maintainers if something is down or some suspicious activity ( 50 failed attempts in 2 mins) are detected.

TODO:

- Possibly make interface to send email / urgent notification flexible, if we or future users decide to move from Discord. ( unlikely but Freenode happened. )

- Figoure out how to work with async APIs in python. 

- Make API for bot to write to channel respond to notifications coming from all clients and backend.
